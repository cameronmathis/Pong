## General info
This is a project I decided I wanted to do in order to practice my C++. I chose to make this game because it was one of the very first video games, released in 1972.

## Setup
In order to play this game, you need g++ installed on a Linux machine. </br>
Clone this repo to a Linux enviroment and navigate to the project. </br>
Use this command to compile the program:
	
	$ ./pong.sh compile

Use this command to run the program: 

	$ ./pong.sh run
  
Once you are done, use this command to clean up the folder:
	
	$ ./pong.sh clean

This will remove the pong.out file.

## Features

## General info
This is a project I decided I wanted to do in order to practice my C++. I chose to make this game because it was one of the very first video games, released in 1972.

## Setup
In order to compile the stack machine, open up the terminal navigate to this project and run:
	
	$ ./pong.sh compile

Run: 

	$ ./stack.sh run
  
Once you are done run:
	
	$ ./pong.sh clean

This will clean up the folder by removing the main.out file.

## Features

## Status
Project is: _in progess_
